  Born in Venezuela and shaped by curiosity, I’ve always been drawn to the way things work—especially in the digital world. Over the years, that curiosity turned into a passion for building technology that’s both useful and meaningful.

  My background in systems engineering gave me a solid foundation in logic, software development, databases, and how systems connect. What drives me most is creating tools that make everyday life smoother and solving real problems with thoughtful solutions.

  Although I’ve grown into a frontend-focused role, I enjoy collaborating on backend design, participating in code reviews, and learning how every part of an application fits together. Lately, I’ve been exploring Go to better understand performance, concurrency, and clean backend architecture.

  Outside of work, I find creativity and challenge in strategy games like Age of Empires II or the fast pace of Valorant. I stay grounded through sports—playing football or going for a run to reset and recharge.

  I’m always learning, always building, and always curious about what’s next.
