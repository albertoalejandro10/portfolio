  Hi, I'm **Alberto Alejandro**, a Frontend Developer based in Venezuela specializing in JavaScript, Vue.js and Nuxt.js.

  ### My Journey

  Born in Venezuela and shaped by curiosity, I've always been drawn to understanding how things work—especially in the digital world. Over the years, that curiosity evolved into a passion for building technology that's both useful and meaningful.

  My background in Systems Engineering gave me a solid foundation in logic, software development, databases, and system architecture. I graduated in 2024 from Universidad de Oriente, where I developed strong skills in programming, algorithms, and understanding how complex systems connect and work together.

  ### What I Do

  I specialize in **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js**, focusing on creating user-centered web applications with clean, maintainable code. I work with modern frontend technologies including TypeScript, Vue Router, Pinia, and API integrations.

  ### My Approach

  What drives me most is creating tools that simplify everyday life and solving real problems with thoughtful solutions. While I've grown into a frontend-focused role, I enjoy collaborating on backend design, participating in code reviews, and understanding how every piece of an application fits together.

  Recently, I've been exploring **Go** to deepen my knowledge of performance optimization, concurrency patterns, and clean backend architecture. I believe in understanding the full stack to build better frontend solutions.

  ### Beyond Code

  Outside of work, I find creativity and challenge in:

  - **Strategy Games**: Age of Empires II helps me think tactically and plan ahead
  - **Competitive Gaming**: Valorant keeps my reflexes sharp and teaches quick decision-making
  - **Sports**: Playing football and tennis, or going for a run to stay grounded and recharge

  I'm always learning, always building, and always curious about what's next. Whether it's a new framework, a design pattern, or a backend technology, I believe continuous growth is key to staying relevant and effective.
