## Overview

GitHub Scraper API is a backend service designed to help developers understand their GitHub network by analyzing profile connections. Using web scraping techniques with Puppeteer, the API extracts data about a user's followers and following, then performs analysis to identify mutual connections and network patterns.

## Key Features

### Profile Analysis

- Extract comprehensive GitHub profile information
- Analyze follower and following lists
- Identify mutual connections between users
- Map network relationships

### API Endpoints

- RESTful API built with Express.js
- Clean and intuitive endpoint structure
- JSON responses for easy integration
- Efficient data retrieval and processing

### Network Insights

- Discover who follows you back
- Identify one-way connections
- Understand your GitHub community
- Export network data for further analysis

## Technical Implementation

Built on **Node.js** with **Express** as the web framework, the API leverages **Puppeteer** for headless browser automation to scrape GitHub pages. This approach allows for reliable data extraction while maintaining compatibility with GitHub's dynamic content loading.

## Use Cases

- **Networking**: Understand your GitHub connections better
- **Community Building**: Identify active members in your network
- **Research**: Analyze GitHub social patterns
- **Professional Development**: Track your growing developer network

## Development

The project demonstrates practical application of web scraping techniques, RESTful API design, and asynchronous JavaScript programming patterns.
