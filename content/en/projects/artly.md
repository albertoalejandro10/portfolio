## Technical Implementation

The app is built with **Flutter** for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android), with **Dart** as the primary language. The backend infrastructure is powered by **Golang**, ensuring efficient API responses and scalability. Development tools include **Android Studio** and **Xcode** for native platform optimization.

## Design Philosophy

Artly focuses on making creativity a daily habit rather than an occasional pursuit. By removing the barrier of "what should I draw?", the app helps artists focus on the practice itself. The social aspect creates accountability and inspiration, while the streak mechanic taps into the same motivational psychology that makes language learning apps successful.

## Development Status

Currently in active development, Artly represents a collaboration between developers passionate about fostering creativity through technology.
